    <h2>April 2024</h2>

    <p>
      Competed in a high-level cybersecurity event solving challenges in network security, cryptography, web vulnerabilities, and OSINT. The team demonstrated collaboration, critical thinking, and real-time problem-solving against experienced opponents.
    </p>

    <h3>My Contributions</h3>
    <p>
      I focused on reconnaissance, OSINT, and hidden file challenges. This included locating concealed files in Kali Linux environments, extracting metadata from digital artifacts, and mapping social media activity to real-world locations. These efforts directly contributed to the team's score and success.
    </p>

    <h3>Challenges & Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hidden Files / Linux:</strong> File enumeration, metadata extraction, steganography.</li>
      <li><strong>OSINT Investigation:</strong> Social media footprint analysis, metadata mapping, location tracing.</li>
      <li><strong>Team Coordination:</strong> Real-time strategy and task allocation under timed conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Event Highlights</h3>
    <p>
      The competition tested rapid problem-solving skills and cybersecurity methodology. Highlights include successful extraction of hidden files and OSINT correlation, contributing to our overall 3rd-place finish.
